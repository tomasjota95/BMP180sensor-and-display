**BMP180 sensing - Temperature and Humidity**

*Serial plotter + OLED displaying on board*

The .ino file opens in Arduino IDE.

It retrieves data from the board, that uses BMP180 to measure temperature and humidity. Then it shows the information on the Serial plotter and on the OLED display connected to the board.
First, you have to connect the board. Then select the port where it's connected on the IDE, and when it shows that connection it's okay, you can then open the serial plotter and see what's happening on the sensor.
(You have to previously downloaded the code to the board, obviusly). If you already downloaded the code, display will show you "TEMP" and "PRESSURE" (PRESION in spanish) with corresponding values.
